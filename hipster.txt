How you make your bash so colorfull in vs code? – Altiano Gerung May 28 '17 at 5:30

Two infos, that might be helpful: make sure, that you escape backslash characters in your json, when writing the path. Also make sure, that you include the 64 bit version of git bash to your vscode, since the 32 bit version might not have the colors by default. (Just remove the " (x86)" part from the path) – Lajos Meszaros Jun 7 '17 at 8:48

Adding to Lajos, if you still cannot see the terminal open up, try restarting vscode. – adityah Sep 1 '17 at 22:30

I was facing issue with "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\bin\bash.exe", terminal was not opening. Tried "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe" . Worked perfectly for me. – KumarDharm Dec 16 '17 at 13:11

FYI, make sure you link to bash.exe, and not git-bash.exe. The latter will open a terminal outside VS code as a separate window, whilst bash.exe will run inside VS code. – Dari
